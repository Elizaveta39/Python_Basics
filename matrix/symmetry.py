# The task is to print YES if the matrix is symmetric and NO if it is not symmetric
# symmetrical means that the elements below the main diagonal are equal to the elements above
# You will get n â€” the number of rows and columns in the matrix
# and then the elements of the matrix - rows with numbers separated by a space

# stopping loop at the first mismatch
# if break works, we print NO
# if loop finishes without break, than else works printing YES
